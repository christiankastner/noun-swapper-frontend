Beat Poems is a program designed to liven up poems or text by identifying nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs in a sentence and replacing them with other random words. You can also have your new beat poem read aloud by a diverse set of different voices and even add music to the reading!

## Installation

After you've followed the [backend instructions](https://github.com/mattgahrns/noun-swapper-backend)

cd into the proper frontend directory and open the index.html in your favorite browser.

Now you can enjoy some fun slam poetry!
